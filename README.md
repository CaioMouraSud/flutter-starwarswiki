<p>This application uses swapi.dev to fill in your data. This application can show planets, spaceships, vehicles, characters, movies, species and their respective interactions.</p>
<p>This application saves this data using the hive, it is a "NoSQL database fast, pleasant and secure", I chose this database because it is "Cross platform: mobile, desktop, browser".</p>
<p>I created a class to link photos about everything within this application. </p>
