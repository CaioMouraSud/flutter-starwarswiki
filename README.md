# StarWars Wiki

<p>This application uses <a href="https://swapi.dev/" target="_blank">swapi.dev</a> to fill in its data. This application can show planets, spaceships, vehicles, characters, movies, species and their respective interactions.</p>
<p>It saves this data using the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/hive" target="_blank">Hive</a>, it is a "NoSQL database fast, pleasant and secure", I chose this database because it is "Cross platform: mobile, desktop, browser".</p>
<p>I created a <a href="https://github.com/CaioMouraSud/starwarswiki/blob/main/lib/app/utils/image_generator.dart">class</a> to link photos about everything within this application.</p>
</br>
<p>This is the first part of the application running on an iOS Emulator and MacOS App</p>
